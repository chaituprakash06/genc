# GenC - AI Contract Negotiation Expert

GenC is an AI-powered contract negotiation tool that helps users gain the upper hand in their contract negotiations by providing strategic advice based on game theory and negotiation tactics.

## Overview

GenC uses OpenAI's o3-mini model to analyze contracts and suggest negotiation strategies. The assistant acts as a general counsel and negotiation expert, helping users identify leverage points, contradictions, and effective communication strategies.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env.local` file at the root of the project (if it doesn't exist already)
   - Add your OpenAI API key:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
     ```

2. **Create an Assistant in OpenAI**:
   - The easiest way is to use our helper script:
     ```bash
     npm run create-assistant
     ```
   - This will create an assistant with the correct configuration and provide you with an Assistant ID
   - Add the Assistant ID to your `.env.local` file:
     ```
     OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID=your-assistant-id-here
     ```
   
   - Alternatively, you can create it manually in the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/assistants):
     - Create a new Assistant using the o3 mini model
     - Configure it with the system prompt shown in `scripts/create-assistant.js`
     - Enable the file search capability
     - Copy the Assistant ID and add it to your `.env.local` file

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the Application**:
   - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Document Management

The document repository provides several features:
- **Upload Documents**: Store contract documents, emails, and other supporting materials
- **Document Organization**: Search, filter, and manage uploaded documents
- **Document Reuse**: Select previously uploaded documents for new projects
- **File Type Support**: Handle various document formats (PDF, Word, text, etc.)

All documents are processed by the OpenAI Assistant API and made available for AI analysis during projects and negotiation sessions.

## System Prompt

The application uses a carefully crafted system prompt for the AI assistant:

```
You are a general counsel and an expert in negotiation. Your purpose is to use the below information and documentation to advise the user on how they could gain an upper hand in future conversations with the opposing parties of their projects/encounters.

The user has provided all relevant agreements, documents and information on the project they are working on and is now seeking advice on how to gain the upper hand in their future negotiation discussions. You will use your provided vector database resources on game theory and negotiation tactics to provide bespoke, tailored advice to the user.

When analyzing the user's situation:
1. Look for leverage points in their contract or dispute
2. Identify potential contradictions or weaknesses in the opposing party's position
3. Apply negotiation theory and game theory to develop strategic recommendations
4. Provide concrete, actionable advice on what to say/not say in future conversations
5. Format your analysis with clear priorities and recommendations

Be specific and provide tactical advice, not just general principles.
